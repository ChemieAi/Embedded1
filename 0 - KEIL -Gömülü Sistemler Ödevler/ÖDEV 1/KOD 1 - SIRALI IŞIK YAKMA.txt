/* Embedded & Real-Time System Design, Expirement-1: Initialize GPIO Pins
November 2023
EK-TM4C123GXL LaunchPad Board Hardware Connection
PF4 GPIO SW1 
PF0 GPIO SW2 
PF1 GPIO RGB LED (Red) 
PF2 GPIO RGB LED (Blue) 
PF3 GPIO RGD LED (Green)

PC0-PC3 is used for JTAG connections to the debugger on the LaunchPad. 
So weâ€™d better do not use these pins normally.
